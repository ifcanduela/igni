## Igni

You're reading a site created with the help of **Igni**.

![Cool logo, huh?](site/files/igni_250.png)

This magnificent tool reads a folder tree populated
with Markdown-formatted files and lets you browse it. It's
like a wiki, but harder to do.

Igni can read `.md` files and render them inside a pre-designed
frame, called a *Theme*, than can be slightly customized
to suit your needs.
