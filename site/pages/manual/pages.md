# Pages

Pages are the main content of the site. You write them in [Markdown](http://daring-firebal.net/projects/markdown) and place them inside the `site/pages` folder. Igni will assign them a URL corresponding to their filename, so this page, `manual/pages` is actually a file named `site/pages/manual/pages.md`.

There's nothing special about pages. This is an example of one:

~~~~
## The title of the page

An introduction. *Emphasize* the content of the page in this 
paragraph, and mention **important** concepts.

- lists
- just need
- a dash for every item
- and you can split items
    in several lines

You can read more at [the F.A.Q. page](faq) and this 
[same page in the manual](manual/pages).
