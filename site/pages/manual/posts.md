# Posts

Posts are like pages, but will display (hopefully) *next* and *previous* links at the bottom of the page. Those links will lead to the appropriate posts in the `site/posts` folder, chronologically speaking.

For the moment the posts list is unavailable, but I'm sure I'll do something about that soon.

previous: [Pages](manual/pages) | next: [Navigation](manual/navigation)
