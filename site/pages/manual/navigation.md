# Site Navigation

There are two main navigation panels: the *top menu* and the *sidebar*. You can modify the `nav.md` and `sidebar.md` files located in the `site/templates` folder to customize their contents.

In the future, specific `_sidebar.md` files in the `site/pages` folder and its subfolder will be loaded whenever a page from that folder is requested, allowing to create sub-navigation blocks.
