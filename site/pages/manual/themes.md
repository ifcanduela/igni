# Themes

Themes are PHP files, so this part is not going to be for the casual user. Still, themes are pretty simple and maybe approachable by everyone. I don't know, really.

To create a theme, you need only two things:

- a sub-folder in the `themes` folder
- a `page.php` file in the sub-folder

The name of said sub-folder is the name of your theme, and the name you must use in the `config.json` file to switch to your theme.
